## 1-4

- Everything that we did on the lesson
- Optimized code by creating functions for request body and response
- Found (with help of copilot) good way to modify properties with PATCH

## 5

- Didn't know what to do so made just simple min, max, sum, average and median calculator from the value keys in the list
- Functionality: items can be posted on the server for example student exam numbers and then highest, lowest, average and median can be calculated
- Works with /items/min, /items/max ect
